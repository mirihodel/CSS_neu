The purpose of this study is to compare newspaper coverage of men’s and women’s Champions
League soccer in different countries using NLP methods and to analyze whether there are
differences in the sentiments used to describe these events. The assumption is that the media
may be biased towards men’s Champions League events and that articles about women’s football
may contain more non-football content, such as political statements or personal opinions. This
study shows that media coverage of Champions League events in the United States, England,
Germany, and Switzerland was more extensive for men, that headlines for men used much more
polarized language than for women, and that men’s football is very much about “big names”.
